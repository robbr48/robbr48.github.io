The Center for Model-Based Cyber-Physical Product Development (MODPROD) is an interdisciplinary research center at Linköping University. The center involves a number of companies as well as researchers from the Department of Computer and Information Science (IDA) and the Department of Management and Engineering (IEI).

The mission of the MODPROD center is to conduct front-line applied research in model-based product development addressing problems such as shorter life cycles, higher demands on flexibility and quality, and shorter time-to-market from product design to  production of finished products. This requires increased usage of software/hardware system modeling, life-cycle management, and simulation technology for virtual prototyping and model-based strategic planning.
